Adminstrative Materials for Secure Academic Data Center
These are files that you can download and use to complete the administrative requirements for hosting high risk data. We have also included the current Stanford Data Management Plan.

Background In 2016, Stanford University received a grant from the Sloan Foundation to build a prototype repository to store, curate and share high risk data for population health research. Additional aims supported research from a team of legal scholars to study standard language in over 200 contracts and synthesize elements which were common to all. The DUA is a preliminary result of this work.

If you decide to use these materials, please include an acknowledgement. Suggested language is below:
