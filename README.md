Background In 2016, Stanford University received a grant from the Sloan Foundation to build a prototype repository to store, curate and share high risk data for population health research. Additional aims supported research from a team of legal scholars to study standard language in over 200 contracts and synthesize elements which were common to all. The DUA is a preliminary result of this work.
